Thank you for download NameNPC. This is the language for the addon.
If you need any help or have a question goto livaco.tk and make a ticket on the dashboard. You will NOT get support anywhere else.
%s is a variable and is used if anything is needed to be put inbetween a text.
Also be careful of text being too long and overlapping other elements or going outside them. Anything marked with a * will have protection for this.
